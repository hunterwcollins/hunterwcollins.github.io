    <p>
        About Me: Greetings! I am a business data expert with a primary focus on Microsoft Power BI, Azure, and the Power Platform. My skills span across data modeling, data visualization, and strategic thinking, all underpinned by a robust knowledge of DAX Query Language, Azure DevOps, Azure Data Factory, and Azure Logic Apps. I'm adept at using PowerApps, Power Automate, and Power Virtual Agents, and I am well-versed in Office 365 suite applications, including SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, and Excel.
        I take pride in my comprehensive understanding of the full cycle of Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), coupled with a proficiency in SQL and SSMS. This combination has allowed me to effectively test solutions and ensure the best outcome for all stakeholders involved.
        Beyond my technical skills, my leadership capabilities and project management prowess have enabled me to lead teams effectively and manage projects using the Scrumban methodology. I believe in the power of clear communication and have developed strong presentation skills, particularly when it comes to client-facing communication. My ability to manage deadlines and maintain excellent client relationships has proven crucial throughout my career.
        Since my graduation from Florida Gulf Coast University, where I pursued both a Bachelor's in Economics and a Bachelor's in Political Science, I have grown professionally in a range of environments. My experience spans multiple industries, where I have had the privilege of working with diverse teams to develop tailored, data-driven solutions.
        I am not just a practitioner but also a certified expert. My recognition as a Microsoft Power BI Associate and Google Certified Data Analyst further substantiates my technical prowess and dedication to my field.
        At the heart of my work, I have a profound passion for problem-solving and using data to drive informed business decisions. Whether it's improving customer satisfaction, boosting sales, or optimizing processes, I am committed to helping businesses uncover their critical success metrics and applying modern analytics to help them thrive.
        I believe that if it can be measured, it can be improved. I look forward to applying this philosophy to new challenges and continue to leverage data to drive success.
